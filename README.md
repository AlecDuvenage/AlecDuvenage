HI THERE, I'M ALEC DUVENAGE

I'm a mechanical engineer and technology fanatic from South Africa, currently living in the United Arab Emirates.

I've always looked for new things to learn and always loved figuring out how they work from both a practical and digital perspective. Thus, I emmersed myself into the world of programming to try and get a better grip of how the digital age currently works, but also how it develops as we move into the future.

My current 'mission' is to gain fluency in Python, as I believe it is one of the most versatile languages to learn.
